# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

In the previous projects I learned how to work with basic DOM manipulation. Now it is time to review what I have learned by building a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
In this mini project, I will review conditionals, functions, getElementById, and more. This project will give me an opportunity to solve small problems and get a better understanding of the basics.
